## How to contribute to Dream ORM

### Install `nodenv`

In order to use dream, you must be using node = 18.15.0. A `.node-version` file exists at the root of this repo to flag the node version, but it will not work unless `nodenv` has been correctly installed on your machine.

### Add ENV files

make sure to add the following files to the root of the project:

```
# .env
DREAM_CORE_DEVELOPMENT=1
DB_USER=YOUR_PG_USERNAME
DB_NAME=dream_core_dev
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
```

```
# .env.test
DREAM_CORE_DEVELOPMENT=1
DB_USER=YOUR_PG_USERNAME
DB_NAME=dream_core_test
DB_PORT=5432
DB_HOST=localhost
```

### Build db and sync schema

```bash
yarn install
NODE_ENV=development yarn dreamcore db:create
NODE_ENV=development yarn dreamcore db:migrate
NODE_ENV=test yarn dreamcore db:create
NODE_ENV=test yarn dreamcore db:migrate
```

## Global CLI

The global CLI is used to build a new psychic app. You can access the global cli on your machine by doing the following:

```bash
yarn dlx @rvohealth/dream
```

Once installed globally, you can access the global cli like so:

```bash
dream new myapp
```

To test the global cli without publishing, you can run the following from within the psychic directory:

```bash
yarn gdreamcore new myapp
```

NOTE: doing so will create the new app in the dream folder, so once done testing remember to remove it.
